Description: MiSurv is an integrative web cloud platform for processing, analyzing and visualizing microbiome data with survival responses. MiSurv consists of a data processing module and following four data analytic modules as follows.

* **Data Processing** : Interactive procedures for 1) data inputs (.rdata, .rds, .biom, .txt, .csv, .tsv, .tre), 2) survival data and analytic plans (survival time, censored/event, follow-up period, subgroup analysis), 3) quality controls (kingdom, library size, mean proportion, taxonomic name), and 4) data transformations (alpha- and beta-diversity calculation, rarefaction, proportion, centered log-ratio, arcsine square root).

* **Module 1** : Comparative survival analysis between treatment groups, not involving microbiome data, with or without covariate adjustment.

* **Module 2** : Comparative analysis in microbial composition between treatment groups, not involving survival data, with or without covariate adjustment.

* **Module 3** : Association testing between microbial composition and survival responses with or without covariate adjustment.

* **Module 4** : Prediction modeling using microbial taxa at different taxonomic ranks on survival responses.
